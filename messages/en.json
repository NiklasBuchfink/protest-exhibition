	"klimakrise": "# The Earth is getting hotter \n\n**For around 150 years, humanity has been heating the planet unnaturally quickly by emitting greenhouse gases. Life on Earth cannot adapt quickly enough.** \n\nThere have always been climatic fluctuations throughout the millions of years of Earth's history. Life on Earth has slowly adapted to these changes. But now the Earth's average temperature is rising unnaturally quickly. This climate change is man-made: It is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases that increase the earth's natural greenhouse effect. The earth is heating up. Since industrialization began around 150 years ago, the average temperature has risen by 1 degree. \n\n[![EUROPE-Germany-1881-2022-DW-barslabel.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/zfMZxDcL/EUROPE-Germany-1881-2022-DW-barslabel.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/WDMH3Vjj)\n**Warming Stripes** , Ed Hawkins,  University of Reading, [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) \n\n*British climate researcher Ed Hawkins has the “ Warming Stripes” were invented to simply represent global warming. In them, the mean temperature of a single year is shown as a narrow color strip: dark blue stands for cool, red for warm. When strung together, the strips create an easy-to-understand barcode. Hawkins has now worked with the British Institute for Environmental Analytics to create warming stripes for many countries around the world. Anyone can download them on the [ShowYourStripes](https://showyourstripes.info/c/europe/germany/all) portal. It is based primarily on the data set from the \"Berkeley Earth\" project.* \n\n### Consequences of warming \n\nFor us humans, 1 degree more or less is hardly noticeable. This one degree is already having far-reaching consequences for the earth. It exceeds the adaptability of nature and humans. Weather extremes such as heavy rain, hail, storms, heat waves and long dry seasons are occurring more frequently around the world. While deserts are spreading around the equator, other parts of the world are sinking into the sea due to rising sea levels. Due to severe drought and a lack of rain, there are more droughts and forest fires in many areas. Because animals and plants cannot adapt to rapid climate change, many species are threatened with extinction. And people are also losing their living space: around 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in regions that could become uninhabitable due to climate change - because they are flooded, do not provide enough food and drinking water or simply become too hot. \n\n### Just one degree more \n\nScientists around the world are researching how the earth's climate is changing. They develop models, so-called climate scenarios. They show how the earth could change - depending on how much CO₂ we humans emit. This means we know that whether the earth warms by 1.5 or 2 degrees has huge effects. \n\n___\n\n **Sources** \n- Climate Action Tracker (2023).

	"content_intro": "# Übersicht der Stationen\n\nWie weit darf Protest gehen? Darüber streitet Deutschland, in Talkshows, in Feuilleton-Beiträgen, auf der Straße. Wir alle wissen, dass wir nicht genug tun, um die Klimakrise einzudämmen. Aber wir sind uneins, was Klimaaktivist:innen tun dürfen, um uns daran zu erinnern. Geht es zu weit, wenn Menschen Straßen oder Flughäfen blockieren? Dürfen sie Bäume und Häuser besetzen? Oder die Schule schwänzen?\nDie Ausstellung “Auf die Straße” greift diese Fragen auf und formt eine neue daraus: Wie weit muss Protest gehen, um gesellschaftliche Veränderung anzustoßen? Sie lädt dich ein, selbst auf die Straße zu treten, Klimaaktivist:innen und ihre Aktionswelt kennenzulernen, und deine eigene Protestform zu finden."
