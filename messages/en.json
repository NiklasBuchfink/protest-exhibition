Life on earth cannot adapt quickly enough.** \n\nThere have always been climatic fluctuations throughout the millions of years of Earth's history. Life on Earth has slowly adapted to these changes. But now the Earth's average temperature is rising unnaturally quickly. This climate change is man-made: It is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases that increase the earth's natural greenhouse effect. The earth is heating up. Since industrialization began around 150 years ago, the average temperature has risen by 1 degree. \n\n[![EUROPE-Germany-1881-2022-DW-barslabel.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/zfMZxDcL/EUROPE-Germany-1881-2022-DW-barslabel.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/WDMH3Vjj)\n**Warming Stripes** , Ed Hawkins,  University of Reading, [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) \n\n*British climate researcher Ed Hawkins has the “ Warming Stripes” were invented to simply represent global warming. In them, the mean temperature of a single year is shown as a narrow color strip: dark blue stands for cool, red for warm. When strung together, the strips create an easy-to-understand barcode. Hawkins has now worked with the British Institute for Environmental Analytics to create warming stripes for many countries around the world. Anyone can download them on the [ShowYourStripes](https://showyourstripes.info/c/europe/germany/all) portal. It is based primarily on the data set from the \"Berkeley Earth\" project.* \n\n### Consequences of warming \n\nFor us humans, 1 degree more or less is hardly noticeable. This one degree is already having far-reaching consequences for the earth. It exceeds the adaptability of nature and humans. Weather extremes such as heavy rain, hail, storms, heat waves and long dry seasons are occurring more frequently around the world. While deserts are spreading around the equator, other parts of the world are sinking into the sea due to rising sea levels. Due to severe drought and a lack of rain, there are more droughts and forest fires in many areas. Because animals and plants cannot adapt to rapid climate change, many species are threatened with extinction. And people are also losing their living space: around 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in regions that could become uninhabitable due to climate change - because they are flooded, do not provide enough food and drinking water or simply become too hot. \n\n### Just one degree more \n\nScientists around the world are researching how the earth's climate is changing. They develop models, so-called climate scenarios. They show how the earth could change - depending on how much CO₂ we humans emit. This means we know that whether the earth warms by 1.5 or 2 degrees has huge effects. \n\n___\n\n# Knowledge and action\n**In order to limit global warming, the international community adopted a climate protection agreement in Paris in 2015. However, the Paris climate targets are still a long way off**.How many greenhouse gases we emit has a direct impact on global warming. When the first World Climate Conference was held in 1979, countries still had a lot of room for maneuver. Despite this, global CO₂ emissions continued to rise. This is set to change: At the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in December 2015, 197 countries agreed on a new, global climate protection agreement. This agreement is what is meant when we talk about the 1.5 degree target or the Paris climate targets. It is considered a milestone in climate protection. The countries have committed to limiting global warming to \"well below\" two degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial age. They also want to endeavor to limit it to 1.5 degrees. The concrete measures (\"Nationally Determined Contributions\") are determined by the states themselves.**What has happened so far**The actual climate protection measures are not yet sufficient to limit global warming to 2 or even 1.5 degrees. In no country on earth. The earth would be around 3 degrees warmer by 2100 if countries were to maintain their current climate protection measures. This would have fatal consequences for people and the environment. For us too: with global warming of 3 degrees, we can expect around 6 degrees of warming in Germany. This will increase the frequency of hot days, droughts and extreme precipitation. **The world can still be saved**The problem: scientists consider the German government's current climate protection measures to be inadequate. They are not enough to achieve its own climate targets, such as climate neutrality by 2045, and certainly not the Paris climate targets. The \"Climate Action Tracker\" research project describes gaps in building laws and in the entire transport sector. Furthermore, the German government's climate target is not ambitious enough. It is inappropriate that Germany, as one of the richest countries in the world, is not fulfilling its own reporting obligations and is not even implementing simple measures such as a general speed limit on freeways (Climate Action Tracker).Translated with DeepL.com (free version)\n\n___\n\n **Sources** The earth is getting hotter\n\n- Climate Action Tracker (2023).
